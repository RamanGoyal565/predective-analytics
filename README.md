# Predictive Analytics Project

## Overview
This repository contains the Predictive Analytics project, which involves data analysis and predictive modeling using R. The project explores various machine learning techniques to make data-driven predictions and insights.

## Repository Structure
- **Predictive Analysis.R** - The main R script containing data processing, analysis, and predictive modeling.
- **Predictive-Analysis.Rmd** - The R Markdown file used to generate the report and HTML output.
- **Predictive-Analysis.html** - The HTML output of the analysis with visualizations and interpretations.
- **PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS PROJECT REPORT.docx** - The final project report documenting methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- R (version 4.x or later)
- RStudio (optional but recommended)
- Required R packages:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "caret", "randomForest", "e1071", "class", "cluster", "flexdashboard"))
  ```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramangoyal565/predictive-analytics.git
   cd predictive-analytics
   ```
2. Run the R Markdown file:
   - Open `Predictive-Analysis.Rmd` in RStudio
   - Click Knit to generate the report
3. Run the R script manually:
   - Open `Predictive Analysis.R`
   - Execute the script line by line in RStudio

## Project Details
This project includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Training predictive models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Clustering techniques: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- Model evaluation and performance analysis

## Results
- The results and insights from predictive models are available in:
  - `Predictive-Analysis.html` (interactive report)
  - `PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS PROJECT REPORT.docx`
